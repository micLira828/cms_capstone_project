    <h2>About The Site</h2>
    <p>This blog is content centered rather than user centered: the content is focused on rather than the user. This means only the content about the blogs is displayed, not the user. You don’t follow the person, like you do on Facebook. You read one blog and view more of their stuff if you are interested!
    You describe your content on your blog pages, not yourself. That removes all self esteem issues of the person. When someone follows you on or likes your social media profile, you get a dopamine fix(or don’t, if someone does not like you). But when someone views your content(or doesn’t), you don’t even see it! They just click on your name and view all the blogs you have and click to read more of them if they are interested. Or don’t click or read more of them. You don’t know a thing. It doesn’t appear as a like or a follow/connection. </p>
    <p>
    Eventually, I want to include a follow feature, but the only thing that will be affected when somebody clicks/follows your content, is the person’s feed: I want to include eventually include a feed on the homepage for each user, where THEY see all the most recent content of everyone. You will not even see the fact that they follow you(or didn’t), but THEY will see all your content updates SHOULD THEY DO SO! 
    </p>
    <p>
    I find this method a win win. A blogger doesn’t get a dopamine drop of someone not following him/her while everyone gets content on their feed customized to their liking’ 
    Also, I eventually want to add a feature to view blog/post traction, but all you would view as a blogger is the NUMBER of people that follow your content/and/or read your blogs/post for tracking purposes for the creator to know which are doing best and attract most attention, so they know better what to do more or less of. We will include that later.
